# 1.1. Top-level Plan

- todo layers:
    - [ ] smart contract layer
        - [x] define detailed plan
        - [ ] try one step
        - [ ] iterate till done
    - [ ] js connector layer (SDK)
        - [ ] detailed plan def
    - [ ] web/
        - [ ] define detailed plan
        - [ ] implement plan steps and glue together
          - use connector in react+tailwindcss to build slick ui (find nice elements from tailwindui and other shiny things when we come to this part)
          - **note:** if u already have some nice component libs or similar can be useful if u send
          - not urgent since will be done last so we have time
        - [ ] iterate till done

## 2.1. Layer: Smart contract level Plan

- smartcontract layer plan:
    - **status:** basic tdd setup, hardhat framework, and flow of test -> small change work
        - just continue like that
    - [ ] convert each statement/requirement in the reqs into series of test sentences
        - smaller, few test cases per feature, pack into test suites
    - [ ] log these in `.txt` format
    - [ ] (?) maybe leave so they see its agnostic to specific lib
    - [ ] ITERATE: incrementally code/build all reqs from list of test suites
        - no regressions, since all prev features covered
        - since all test covered IN SEQUENCE this will be the case, hence TDD
        - important: name test suites well and in order
          - this good, sb can just go through tests and see how it was built
          - same for each logical part (test suite per logical unit/feature)
      - [ ] special considerations
          - [ ] also need to be careful with edge cases, key ie in yield calc
          - important: use existing similar contracts for ref (already found em)

## 2.2. web/ Plan

- [ ] add lib/ for connecting to `Vault.sol` contract
    - [ ] note: be careful to be able to extract it to npm-able
