Test Cases:

Normal Cases:
- Initialize contract with valid WETH address and yearly yield.
- Verify contract deployment with correct owner.
- Ensure reward pool is set to the predefined amount.

Edge Cases:
- Attempt initialization with zero address.
- Attempt initialization with zero yearly yield.
- Attempt initialization with an invalid token contract.

Multi-Interaction Cases:
- Deploy the contract, then verify multiple initializations fail.
- Initialize with varying amounts and check reward pool adjustments.
- Initialize and then try changing ownership immediately.
